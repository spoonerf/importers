    """yields batches of an iterable in batches of size n.

    Divides an iterable into batches of size n, yielding one batch at a time.

    Arguments:

        iterable: Iterable[Any]. Iterable (list, np.array, ...) to be split into
            batches. Must be an iterable that can be sliced (e.g. `iterable[0:5]`)
            and must have a length.

        batch_size: int = 1000. Size of each batch.

    Yields:

        Iterable[Any]. Batch from iterable.

    Example::

        >>> data = list(range(0,11))
        >>> for batch in batchify(data, 3):
        >>>     print(batch)
        [0, 1, 2]
